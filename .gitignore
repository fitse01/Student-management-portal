Video content: second:0 text:one her to constantly think about you
second:2 text:here&#39;s why you&#39;re getting it all wrong
second:4 text:you&#39;re trying too hard texting too much
second:7 text:and ending up looking desperate but
second:9 text:guess what there&#39;s a smarter way to get
second:11 text:her obsessed with you even when you&#39;re
second:13 text:not around I&#39;ll teach you that
second:15 text:[Music]
second:18 text:today welcome back Jessica o is here so
second:21 text:I&#39;m going to give you the blueprint and
second:23 text:I promise you after this she won&#39;t just
second:26 text:think about you she&#39;ll need you but
second:28 text:first let&#39;s get one thing straight if
second:30 text:you&#39;re going for quick fixes shallow
second:32 text:tricks Etc this ain&#39;t for you this is
second:35 text:for men who want to play the long game
second:37 text:and win big in her mind and in her heart
second:40 text:the first thing you need to do is to
second:42 text:make her invest in you now here&#39;s a
second:45 text:secret that not enough men understand if
second:48 text:you want her to constantly think about
second:49 text:you she has to invest in you most guys
second:52 text:think that they should be doing all the
second:53 text:work planning all the dates making all
second:55 text:the moves you know trying to impress her
second:58 text:every single second but if she&#39;s not
second:59 text:putting anything into the relationship
second:61 text:guess what she&#39;s not going to feel as
second:63 text:attached as you&#39;d hope for think of it
second:65 text:this way people value what they invest
second:67 text:in the more energy eff for emotion that
second:69 text:she puts into you the more she&#39;ll value
second:72 text:the relationship and that&#39;s exactly what
second:73 text:you want if you&#39;re always the one
second:75 text:investing in giving she&#39;ll take it for
second:77 text:granted but when she starts investing in
second:79 text:you that&#39;s when things change I&#39;ll break
second:82 text:it down a little bit more when you ask
second:84 text:her to contribute whether it&#39;s planning
second:85 text:a date making a decision or just putting
second:87 text:in effort to keep things going it does
second:89 text:two powerful things first it shows her
second:91 text:that you&#39;re worth the effort you&#39;re not
second:93 text:just some guy who&#39;s trying to impress
second:94 text:her you&#39;re a man who knows his value and
second:96 text:expects a woman to step up as well and
second:99 text:second it creates emotional involvement
second:102 text:okay when she&#39;s the one investing in you
second:104 text:she&#39;s going to feel a deeper connection
second:106 text:and that&#39;s just how the human brain
second:108 text:works you see when a woman invests her
second:109 text:time and energy into you it&#39;s no longer
second:112 text:just about you impressing her it&#39;s about
second:114 text:both of you building something together
second:117 text:and guess what she&#39;s not going to let
second:118 text:that go easily when she&#39;s actively
second:120 text:contributing she&#39;ll start thinking about
second:122 text:you more because now she&#39;s emotionally
second:124 text:invested in the outcome she wants it to
second:127 text:work so how do you get her to invest
second:129 text:start small instead of planning every
second:131 text:single date you want to ask her what&#39;s
second:133 text:something you love for us to do this
second:134 text:weekend or why don&#39;t you pick a spot for
second:136 text:dinner tonight by giving her the
second:138 text:opportunity to take the Reign
second:140 text:occasionally she&#39;s investing in the
second:141 text:relationship and here&#39;s the thing when
second:143 text:she puts effort into planning she&#39;s also
second:146 text:thinking about you while she does that
second:148 text:she&#39;s imagining how much fun you&#39;ll have
second:149 text:together how much you&#39;ll enjoy the
second:151 text:experience Etc and this will build
second:154 text:anticipation which will keep you on her
second:156 text:mind but it doesn&#39;t stop there ask for
second:158 text:her opinions her advice from time to
second:160 text:time get her to open up and share her
second:162 text:thoughts on things that matter to you
second:164 text:whether it&#39;s asking her about something
second:165 text:work rated or getting her perspective on
second:167 text:a personal decision you&#39;re making her
second:169 text:feel like she&#39;s a valuable part of your
second:171 text:life and when a woman feels valued she&#39;s
second:174 text:hooked it&#39;s all about balance right
second:176 text:you&#39;re not handing over all your power
second:177 text:to her but you&#39;re letting her feel like
second:179 text:she&#39;s contributing it&#39;s a subtle shift
second:182 text:that creates a powerful psychological
second:183 text:connection and believe me once she&#39;s
second:185 text:emotionally invested in you it&#39;s hard
second:187 text:for her to walk away second thing you
second:189 text:want to do is don&#39;t always be available
second:191 text:right you need to make her miss you so
second:195 text:let me ask you one question what happens
second:197 text:when something is too easy to get you
second:200 text:stop valuing it right it&#39;s exactly what
second:203 text:happens when you&#39;re always available to
second:204 text:her you text her back the moment she
second:206 text:messages you you&#39;re there at the snap of
second:208 text:her fingers and you think that&#39;s showing
second:210 text:how much you care but in reality you&#39;re
second:212 text:actually killing the attraction you see
second:214 text:attraction thrives on tension it&#39;s built
second:216 text:on mystery on anticipation when you&#39;re
second:218 text:constantly available you&#39;re giving away
second:221 text:your power of mystery she needs time to
second:223 text:think about you to wonder what you&#39;re up
second:225 text:to if she knows exactly where you are
second:227 text:and that you&#39;re just waiting for a call
second:229 text:she&#39;ll lose the excitement here&#39;s what
second:231 text:you should do instead when she texts you
second:233 text:don&#39;t drop everything and respond
second:235 text:immediately take your time don&#39;t always
second:237 text:be the first to text her in the morning
second:239 text:either let her Reach Out occasionally
second:242 text:what you&#39;re doing is creating a space
second:243 text:for her to miss you and believe me when
second:245 text:she starts missing you she&#39;ll start
second:247 text:thinking about you even more by not
second:250 text:always being available you&#39;re making
second:252 text:every interaction with you more
second:253 text:meaningful the fewer texts you send the
second:256 text:more valuable they become you see if she
second:258 text:doesn&#39;t hear from you for a while and
second:260 text:then bam out of nowhere you send her a
second:261 text:wellth out intriguing message she&#39;ll be
second:264 text:hanging on to every word and guess what
second:266 text:now she&#39;s thinking about you you&#39;re
second:268 text:occupying her mind filling the gaps with
second:270 text:curiosity and desire remember the goal
second:272 text:isn&#39;t to make her anxious or unsure of
second:275 text:your feelings it&#39;s to shift the power
second:277 text:Dynamic so you&#39;re not the one who&#39;s
second:279 text:always at her disposal and you need to
second:281 text:remember that okay you you&#39;re creating
second:283 text:value through scarcity so focus on your
second:286 text:own life invest in your own goals your
second:288 text:hobbies do your thing with your boys or
second:290 text:your girls I mean when you&#39;re out there
second:292 text:being the best version of yourself and
second:294 text:not constantly chasing her she&#39;ll start
second:296 text:chasing you you know and that&#39;s when
second:298 text:you&#39;ve really won the game game number
second:301 text:three leave a mark make an emotional
second:304 text:impression so if you want her to think
second:306 text:about you constantly you&#39;ve got to make
second:307 text:her feel something deep and I&#39;m not
second:310 text:talking about just making her laugh or
second:311 text:have a good time on a date I&#39;m talking
second:313 text:about creating emotional experiences
second:315 text:that will leave her thinking about you
second:317 text:long after the moment is over you see
second:319 text:attraction Fades when it&#39;s built on
second:321 text:surface level stuff looks charm a good
second:324 text:sense of humor they&#39;ll only get you so
second:326 text:far what sticks how you make her feel if
second:330 text:you can tap into her emotions whether
second:332 text:it&#39;s by making her feel safe seen or
second:334 text:understood you&#39;re going to leave that
second:336 text:Lasting Impression how do you do it it&#39;s
second:338 text:by being thoughtful creating moments
second:341 text:that show her that you truly care the
second:342 text:kind of moments that are so unique and
second:344 text:so personal that no one else can easily
second:346 text:replicate them that&#39;s what makes you
second:348 text:Unforgettable so you want to think about
second:351 text:like the things that matter to her right
second:352 text:maybe she&#39;s mentioned a memory from her
second:354 text:childhood or a passion that she has for
second:357 text:instance that you can tie into your time
second:358 text:together when you take take the time to
second:360 text:do something personal and meaningful
second:362 text:you&#39;re not just any guy you&#39;re the guy
second:363 text:who made her feel deeply and let me tell
second:367 text:you emotions have a way of staying with
second:368 text:us long after the moment has passed I
second:371 text:mean it doesn&#39;t have to be a grand
second:372 text:gesture sometimes it&#39;s the little things
second:374 text:that hit the hardest so focus on those
second:377 text:when you show her that you&#39;re
second:378 text:emotionally invested and that you&#39;ve
second:381 text:actually been paying attention when she
second:382 text:speaks she&#39;ll start to see you in a
second:384 text:completely different light so it&#39;s not
second:386 text:no longer this guy who&#39;s just surface
second:387 text:level wants to get into her pants but
second:389 text:you&#39;re legit concerned right the goal
second:392 text:here is to build that emotional intimacy
second:394 text:when you connect with her on a deeper
second:396 text:level she&#39;ll think about you not just
second:398 text:when you&#39;re around but when she&#39;s alone
second:400 text:as well she&#39;ll think about how you made
second:401 text:her feel understood valued special and
second:404 text:that&#39;s the feeling that she&#39;s going to
second:406 text:chase here&#39;s a
second:407 text:tip find out what&#39;s important to her
second:410 text:emotionally right is it her career is it
second:412 text:her family her passions show her that
second:414 text:you care about what she cares about
second:416 text:don&#39;t just hear her listen to her when
second:419 text:she realizes that you&#39;re the guy who
second:420 text:actually listens you become someone she
second:423 text:emotionally relies on and that&#39;s
second:425 text:powerful you don&#39;t need to be the most
second:427 text:Charming guy in the world but if you can
second:429 text:make her feel deeply she won&#39;t just
second:431 text:think about you she&#39;ll need to be around
second:434 text:you she&#39;ll associate you with those
second:436 text:positive powerful emotions and that&#39;s
second:439 text:where the real attraction lies number
second:442 text:four surprise her but don&#39;t be
second:446 text:predictable so let me tell you something
second:448 text:predictability is the enemy of
second:449 text:excitement
second:450 text:right if she knows exactly what you&#39;re
second:452 text:going to do where you&#39;re going to take
second:453 text:her what you&#39;re going to say she&#39;ll lose
second:456 text:interest somewhere along the line cuz
second:458 text:there&#39;s no surprise there so you want to
second:459 text:stop doing the same old thing if you&#39;re
second:461 text:always texting good morning or sending
second:463 text:her the same how was your day well
second:465 text:you&#39;re becoming predictable and
second:467 text:predictability doesn&#39;t get you noticed
second:470 text:it gets you forgotten and of course
second:471 text:taken for granted as well right so how
second:473 text:do you keep her on her toes constantly
second:475 text:thinking about you it&#39;s simple surprise
second:477 text:her when she least expects it not with a
second:479 text:grand gesture or over the toop display
second:481 text:but the little moments that show you&#39;re
second:483 text:paying attention it&#39;s about catching her
second:485 text:off guard in a way that makes her think
second:486 text:wow I didn&#39;t see that coming but it&#39;s so
second:489 text:him right let me give you an example
second:491 text:imagine this she told you about a rough
second:493 text:week at work right instead of sending
second:494 text:the same old oh I hope it gets better
second:496 text:message you drop by a place with a
second:498 text:favorite meal or send her a voice note
second:500 text:saying hey I know it&#39;s tough right now
second:502 text:but I&#39;m here if you need a laugh and
second:504 text:just like that you&#39;ve just disrupted her
second:507 text:day in the best way possible you&#39;ve
second:509 text:shown her that you thought ful you&#39;re
second:510 text:unpredictable as well and this is
second:512 text:happening all at once now let me be
second:515 text:clear okay you don&#39;t want to be
second:517 text:unpredictable in a way that&#39;s unsettling
second:519 text:or inconsistent this isn&#39;t about being
second:521 text:flaky or unreliable it&#39;s about creating
second:524 text:excitement in a relationship that makes
second:525 text:her wonder what&#39;s he going to do next
second:527 text:and when you can get her thinking about
second:529 text:what you might do next you&#39;ve already
second:530 text:won you&#39;re taking up mental real estate
second:533 text:in her mind be intentional with your
second:535 text:surprises a random voice note during the
second:537 text:day an unexpected thoughtful message or
second:539 text:planning a spontaneous low-key date
second:541 text:based on something you know she loves
second:543 text:these are the kinds of surprises that
second:545 text:make her feel special and keep you in
second:547 text:her thoughts but don&#39;t overdo it if
second:549 text:you&#39;re constantly surprising her you
second:551 text:become predictable okay so you want to
second:553 text:strike that balance and keep in mind
second:555 text:that it&#39;s the thought behind the
second:557 text:surprise that counts and not necessarily
second:559 text:the price tag number five you want to be
second:561 text:a little mysterious don&#39;t reveal
second:564 text:everything now one of the biggest
second:566 text:mistakes men make when they like a woman
second:569 text:is basically just laying all their cards
second:571 text:on the table too soon they spill
second:573 text:everything everything about themselves
second:575 text:what they do what they like what they
second:577 text:want thinking that full transparency is
second:580 text:actually the way to win her over but the
second:582 text:mystery is what actually keeps people
second:584 text:intrigued right mystery so if you want
second:587 text:her to constantly think about you you&#39;ve
second:589 text:got to leave some things unsaid right
second:592 text:here&#39;s the thing when she knows
second:593 text:everything about you right away there&#39;s
second:595 text:no room for that Curiosity I I talk
second:597 text:about a lot in my videos and let me tell
second:599 text:you curi is powerful curiosity keeps her
second:601 text:thinking what&#39;s going on in his head
second:603 text:what&#39;s he doing when he&#39;s not with me
second:605 text:what&#39;s his story you know and that
second:607 text:curiosity is exactly what you want it
second:609 text:keeps you on her mind even when you&#39;re
second:611 text:not around you don&#39;t have to be Shady or
second:614 text:secretive but you also don&#39;t need to
second:616 text:give her the full rundown of your life
second:618 text:story on day one keep the conversation
second:621 text:interesting but leave certain parts of
second:623 text:your life a little vague let her ask the
second:626 text:questions and when she does don&#39;t be
second:627 text:afraid to playfully Dodge them every now
second:629 text:and again it&#39;s about creating a dynamic
second:631 text:where she feels like there&#39;s always more
second:632 text:to learn about you right you&#39;re not
second:635 text:being evasive you&#39;re just being a little
second:636 text:elusive in a way that builds her
second:639 text:curiosity when she&#39;s curious she&#39;ll want
second:641 text:to dig deeper and when she wants to dig
second:644 text:deeper guess what she&#39;s thinking about
second:646 text:you your occupying space in her mind and
second:650 text:that&#39;s where you want to be if she feels
second:651 text:like she has access to you 24/7 the
second:654 text:mystery will start to fade so you want
second:656 text:to mix it up don&#39;t respond to every text
second:658 text:instantly don&#39;t always be the one to
second:660 text:initiate plans let her wander what
second:662 text:you&#39;re up to the more she wanders the
second:664 text:more she thinks about you so there you
second:666 text:have it want her to constantly think
second:668 text:about you follow these steps I just
second:670 text:shared in this video and trust me she&#39;ll
second:671 text:be obsessed but remember this only works
second:674 text:if you&#39;re genuinely interested in her
second:676 text:and if she&#39;s genuinely interested in you
second:678 text:manipulation is not the game here it&#39;s
second:680 text:about creating real connections and
second:682 text:making yourself someone she can&#39;t forget
second:684 text:if you want to learn more subscribe to
second:686 text:this Channel and uh smash that like
